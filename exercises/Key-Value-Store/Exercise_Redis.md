How to run Redis in Docker

Before proceeding, we recommend installing Docker Desktop. Desktop is built upon Docker Engine and packages together the Docker CLI, Docker Compose, and more. 
Running Docker Desktop lets you use Docker commands. It also helps you manage images and containers using the Docker Dashboard UI. 

Search for the official Redis image on Docker Desktop and pull it.

when completed you can go to Containers and start it. In the "Exec" tab: type in "redis-cli" to beginn.
